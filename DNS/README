DNS Cache Poisoning attack against a resolver at 172.17.152.150 and DNS auth server at 172.17.152.149
Trying to set the cache for whenry_49094902fea7938f.propaganda.hc to the ip address 172.17.152.149
instead of 172.17.152.146

The attack was successful in a contained environment of VM's on the UGA network

DNS transaction id was unknown. Scapy is used for sppofing packets

The attack is fully automated via script.sh since the cache TTL of a result from the resolver to authority
server is 60 s. Upon successful poisoning, a HTTP get request is sent to the compromised server also
located on 172.17.152.149
